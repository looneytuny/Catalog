Catalog
The Catalog project will allow users to log in and log out into the system in order 
to create, read, update, and delete catalogs and its items. 

Getting Started
In the Catalog folder that holds this file, there is a file called "application.py."
Open "application.py." in order to start the program. Once that is done, please go 
to your browser and type in "localhost:8000" to begin testing the project.

Prerequisites
Please install the python compiler, https://www.python.org/getit/, in order to run this file.
Download Python 3.7.0 set up in order to begin installation. 

Give examples
Once the python 3.7.0 is downloaded, open the program and follow the instructions given.
Make sure that you have IDLE installed once you're down.
For windows, click the start menu and search for "IDLE" to check if it's there.

To make sure python is installed, open up the command line and type "python".
It'll give you a version number.

If these steps have failed, redo the installation from the python 3.7.0 setup application. 

Running the tests
After opening "application.py.", go to your browser and type in "localhost:8000." This
will take you to the main page in the project where you would need to log in to work
with the system.

You will will able to read catalogs as a non-user, but the project will require you
to log in to do any creates, updates, or deletes.

If the user is able to login and create, read, update, and delete, the project is working.

Deployment
After opening "application.py.", go to your browser and type in "localhost:8000."
